                <h1>Football</h1>
                <h3>I enjoy playing football in my free time.
                    It’s not only a fun and competitive sport but also a great way to stay physically active and healthy. Football helps me build teamwork skills, improve my stamina, and keep my mind sharp. It's also a perfect break from my studies, allowing me to recharge and return with more energy and focus. Playing regularly has taught me discipline, patience, and the importance of collaboration, which I find valuable both on and off the field.</h3>

                <h1>Horses</h1>
                <h3>I enjoy spending time with horses in my free time.
                    Being around horses is not only calming but also a great way to stay active and connect with nature. Caring for and riding horses has taught me a lot about responsibility, patience, and trust. Horses have a unique ability to sense emotions, and building a bond with them requires both gentleness and confidence. Riding is also a fantastic workout that strengthens the body while giving a sense of freedom. Spending time with horses has helped me develop a deeper appreciation for animals and the peacefulness they bring.</h3>

                <h1>Coding</h1>
                <h3>For me, coding is more than just a skill—it's a creative outlet where I can build, solve problems, and continuously learn. It’s like solving a complex puzzle, and the sense of accomplishment when something works perfectly is incredibly rewarding. Coding helps me develop critical thinking, attention to detail, and perseverance. Whether I'm learning new programming languages or working on personal projects like mobile apps, coding gives me the opportunity to innovate and challenge myself. It’s both a passion and a way to prepare myself for a future in mobile development.</h3>

                <h1>Movie</h1>
                <h3>Movies are not just a form of entertainment for me—they offer a way to explore different worlds, cultures, and perspectives. I love how films can evoke emotions, tell powerful stories, and make you think in new ways. Whether it’s an action-packed thriller, a thought-provoking drama, or a visually stunning sci-fi, I find that movies can inspire creativity and spark interesting ideas. Watching films also helps me relax and take a break from my studies, while sometimes giving me new insights that I can apply to my work and projects.</h3>
